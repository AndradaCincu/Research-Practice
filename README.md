W1: I have completed Chapter 1, where I wrote about introduction, motivation and research context. I have also started to write the structure of the paper where I have written briefly only about the first two chapters and I will complete the other chapters as I go along.

W2: I applied cnn-lstm but had the same errors I had last time.  I had only cnn and with that I had no problems, but when I apply cnn-lstm I have errors.  I'll try one more method and if that fails I'll look for a paper that applies cnn on the BreakHis dataset this week.  And next week I'll start my own implementation.

W3: I fixed the error I had. I applied CNN-LSTM.

W4: I have collected the data and visualized the data from the chosen dataset and will continue with the preprocessing. In parallel with the experimental part, still having a few bugs to work out.

W5: Implemented ResNet50 model, trying to improve the accuracy on the cnn-lstm model beacusea i have, every time i run it, 0.6799 now that i've added the lstm part
