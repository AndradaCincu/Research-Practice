W1: I have completed Chapter 1, where I wrote about introduction, motivation and research context. I have also started to write the structure of the paper where I have written briefly only about the first two chapters and I will complete the other chapters as I go along.

W2: I applied cnn-lstm but had the same errors I had last time.  I had only cnn and with that I had no problems, but when I apply cnn-lstm I have errors.  I'll try one more method and if that fails I'll look for a paper that applies cnn on the BreakHis dataset this week.  And next week I'll start my own implementation.

W3: I fixed the error I had. I applied CNN-LSTM.

W4: I have collected the data and visualized the data from the chosen dataset and will continue with the preprocessing. In parallel with the experimental part, still having a few bugs to work out.

W5: Implemented ResNet50 model, trying to improve the accuracy on the cnn-lstm model beacusea i have, every time i run it, 0.6799 now that i've added the lstm part

W6: No results in improving the accuracy. I'm still trying to improve it and i have also read some other papers to look for a new aproach.

W7:I have found another paper and implemented with succes everything. I just need to train one more model from the paper. And I will continue to improve the CNN-LSTM model as part of the main-personal implementation

W8: I have implemented InceptionV3 model where I had some problems because it was overfitted. I fixed the overfitted part but i got 0.69 accuracy and I will try to fix it for next week.

W9: I have fixed the overfitted part for the ResNet50 model but right now I'm trying to improve the accuracy for both resnet50 and inceptionv3

W10: Improved the accuracy for the ResNet50 model up to 81%
